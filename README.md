# Assignment2-RT1
The main purpose of this project is to drive a robot in a specific path, while avoiding the wall, as it also decreases and increases its velocity according to the input given by a user.However, by calling a built in service 'reset_position', which means the robot will restart from its initial state.

# Flowchart:

The above flowchart describes the logic based on which the robot is acting in a way to follow its path with specific speed.
First, the robot will drive forward checking the distances on its left, right and front.Getting the minimum ranges on these three directions, the robot has 8 cases to check while driving.Starting with the minimum front distance on the left, if this distance is greater than one it means that it has to check its front and right distances. If both directions are greater than 1 than the robot is safe, while if the right side is not safe obviously the robot has to turn on its left, while if the front side is not safe wich means less than 1, then the robot has to turn on its left. Those 4 cases show that when the left side is safe, once one of the other sides is not, then the robot directly will take the safe side which is the left one. Otherwise, if the three of them are safe then will drive forward.
But in the case where the minimum left distance is less than 1 the robot has to take the right direction, unless, the front side is safe and the others are not then the robot will drive forward.

# Services:

Services are another way to pass data between nodes in ROS. Services are just synchronous remote procedure calls; they allow one node to call a function that executes in another node. The first step in creating a new service is to define the service call inputs and outputs, in our case is called 'speed.srv' which is a custom service. Our example service, send as input a string, This means that the input to the service call should be a string and the output should be a float which is the new speed of the robot that can be increased or decreased. As for the server part, written in the controller code,specifies a callback that will be run when the service call is made, and then waits for requests to come in.For the client part, once the service is called a UI will ask the user to enter a character 'I' for increase and 'D' for decrease and this request will be sent to the server and contorlling the speed of the robot.
In the case of a built in service, in our example we used the "reset position', once this service is called the robot will restart from its initial position.
# Topics:
Topics have anonymous publish/subscribe semantics,they are intended for unidirectional, streaming communication. A node that is interested in a certain kind of data will subscribe to the appropriate topic. In our example, the base_scan topic is used to get all the distances from 0 to 180 degrees of the robot giving 720 ranges.The main purpose of using this topic is to detect the ditances and control the robot upon it.
